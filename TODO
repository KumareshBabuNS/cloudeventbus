- Add support for building .zip to Gradle build
- Configure Travis CI.
- Implement a local EventBus for testing.
- Implement server clustering
  - Advertise cluster info to clients for fail-over
  - Advertise connection state (number of clients, etc.) if peer has significantly less load, redirect new clients to peer
- Add support for remembering the last client or server cert/key used to simplify repeated execution of CLI tools
- Performance test
- Experiment with how much performance benefit direct buffers will really give us
- Implement VCAP component based server
  - Use NATS for peer discover
    - NATS 0.5 release
  - Publish component info on NATS, /varz and /healthz - Get a release of Java component framework out
- Implement a VCAP service gateway
- Lower disconnect timeout if client doesn't authenticate. No ping unless server is ready
- Create a BOSH release
- Browser client/server (websocket based, maybe engine.io based)
- Build a Node.js client
- Build a NATS/Cloud Event Bus gateway - This will allow applications to safely subscribe to NATS messages.
- Write a wiki about why we don't support "send" (publishing to a single recipient) -- How do you deal with wild cards? Or should we turn wild card support off?
- Write documentation and tutorials
- Revamp exceptions - Fewer exception, move error codes to common module.
